<h1>Welcome to My Personal Webpage</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Jonathan but people do call me small fry. I want to give a few facts about myself.</p>
<p> I worked as a camp counselor and this year I got promoted to a supervisor.</p>
<p> I like playing basketball and video games and learn different things about coding on my free time.</p>
<p> My goal is to become a video game designer and improve myself on different coding languages</p>
